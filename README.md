# 🧊 Cryolytix - Smart Cold-Chain Monitoring Solution

Cryolytix is a proprietary IoT (Internet of Things) monitoring solution designed to provide businesses with real-time insights into their cold-chain equipment. Our platform enables businesses to track temperature, voltage, and location of critical equipment such as refrigerators, freezers, and other temperature-sensitive devices.

By leveraging advanced sensor data and analytics, Cryolytix helps businesses reduce equipment downtime, prevent loss of goods, and optimize operational efficiency.

## 📋 Project Overview

Cryolytix is a comprehensive IoT monitoring platform that integrates with sensors to collect real-time data from equipment such as refrigerators and freezers. The backend system processes the data and provides users with alerts, insights, and reports to ensure optimal performance and prevent equipment failures.

### 🛠️ Core Features:

**Real-Time Monitoring**: Track temperature, voltage, and location in real-time.
**Alert System**: Get notifications when equipment conditions exceed predefined thresholds.
**Data Analytics**: View historical data and trends to optimize operations.
**Device Management**: Manage all connected devices through a centralized dashboard.
**User Roles & Permissions**: Role-based access control for security and multi-user environments.

## 🧩 Technical Details

The Cryolytix platform is built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, security, and performance.

## How Cryolytix Works

1. Data Collection: Sensors installed on refrigerators/freezers collect data such as temperature, voltage, and location.
2. Data Transmission: The sensor data is transmitted to the backend via an MQTT broker.
3. Data Processing: The backend system processes the incoming data and stores it in the appropriate databases.
4. Alerts and Notifications: Users receive real-time alerts if the system detects an anomaly (e.g., temperature exceeds a thresholdEntity).
5. Analytics Dashboard: Users can log into the Cryolytix dashboard to view historical data, generate reports, and manage devices.

## 🚀 Business Use Cases

The Cryolytix platform is suitable for a wide range of industries that require temperature-sensitive monitoring, including:

Industry	Use Case
Food & Beverage	Prevent spoilage by monitoring cold storage units.
Pharmaceuticals	Ensure compliance with temperature regulations.
Logistics & Transportation	Monitor cold-chain integrity during transport.
Data Centers	Prevent overheating of critical equipment.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

Cryolytix takes security and privacy seriously. Our platform includes:

* Encrypted data transmission between devices and the backend.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users only have access to the data they need.
* Regular security audits to ensure the platform remains secure.
